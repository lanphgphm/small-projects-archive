# Querying & Building Relational Database with SQL 

The directory named "ProjectManagement" contains a relational database for a company to manage project. This database was given by my instructor , along with a set of questions for me to practice querying. 

The directory named "rmc" contains a relational database that stores students rating for courses in a university. I created this to practice designing and building a database from scratch. There is: 
- "requirement-schema-erd.pdf" which contains the design specification
- "rmc.sql", the SQL code for the database
- "rmc-constraints.sql", which enforces constraints on this database
- "rmc-query-practice.sql", which is to query and test the database
