# Learning NLP 

This repository contains documents related to my learning Natural Language Processing. Ultimate goal of this project is to build a Question-Answering model to complete 2 tasks:
### Task 1 
Given a document (paragraph of text), generate questions relevant to the document. 

### Task 2 
Given a document (paragraph of text) and a questions whose answer can be found in the document, provide the answer to that question. 

The QA model is stored at: https://github.com/siddankthep/NLP-QA in collaboration with @siddankthep
