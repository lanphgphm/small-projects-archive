# Competitive Programming Puzzles 

I lost most of my solution files while migrating to a new OS and messing up with my harddrive. This is all I have left, which is not a lot, because shortly after beginning my new OS I decided to pursue OS instead of CP. 

Alas, I made good friends and had great memories along the way. So these small programs hold a very special place in my heart. 

So long!
